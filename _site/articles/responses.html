<p>An author questionnaire is a form that a publisher sends to its authors to collect details such as name, publications, biography, contacts, professional interests, PR opportunities, etc. As a library, your organization can use this data for cataloging purposes.</p>

<p>A questionnaire response becomes visible to a library after the publisher has made a deliberate choice to share it. This happens at a point in the publisher’s workflow when the questionnaire is locked to further changes by authors or staff.</p>

<h2 id="associated-questionnaires">Associated questionnaires</h2>

<p>When you log into OAQ as a library user, your initial view is the complete set of responses your organization has received across all publishers. The <strong>Questionnaire</strong> column will show the hyperlinked name of each questionnaire associated with the response. If you click one of these hyperlinked names, you will see a list of responses for just that questionnaire.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-response-data">Exporting response data</h3>

<p>The <strong>Responses for <em>questionnaire name</em></strong> page provides you with the option to <strong>Export all responses</strong>. If you click this button, a CSV file containing all responses in the list will begin downloading.</p>

<p>You can also download individual responses by clicking the <strong>Download</strong> dropdown next to any response and choosing to download either a <strong>CSV</strong> or <strong>PDF</strong> file.</p>

<h2 id="response-status">Response status</h2>

<p>Here’s an explanation of the <strong>Status</strong> dropdown menu options on the <strong>Responses</strong> page:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Status</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Not processed</td>
      <td>The library has received the response from the publisher but has not begun processing it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Library In Progress</td>
      <td>The library has received the response from the publisher and begun processing it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Library Complete</td>
      <td>The library has received the response from the publisher and finished processing it.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="actions-you-can-perform-on-a-response">Actions you can perform on a response</h2>

<p>As a library user, OAQ allows you to perform a number of actions on questionnaire responses. When you first log in, or when you click <strong>Responses</strong> in the top bar, you will see a list of received responses from across all publishers. The column titled <strong>Actions</strong> lists the actions you can perform on each one:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>View</td>
      <td>Shows a view of the response in HTML format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status History</td>
      <td>Pops up a window that shows a response’s history of status-changing events.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>View ISBN</td>
      <td>Shows any ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 that the publisher has associated with the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Download</td>
      <td>Begins downloading a <strong>CSV</strong> or <strong>PDF</strong> file, depending on the dropdown selection.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="status-history">Status History</h3>

<p>You can see the history of library-workflow events that have been performed on each response by clicking <strong>Status History</strong> under <strong>Actions</strong>. Clicking this link will pop up a window that shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The email address of the user who changed the status</li>
  <li>The updated status</li>
  <li>The timestamp of the status change</li>
</ul>

<p>If a response’s status has never been changed, the popup window will be blank.</p>
