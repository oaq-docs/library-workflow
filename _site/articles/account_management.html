<p>OAQ is designed to be a multi-tenant platform, which means multiple libraries can use it simultaneously with their own users and branding. This means your organization’s data will remain invisible to other libraries.</p>

<p>Note that when we say “library” in this documentation, we mean an organization with an <a href="organizations">organization type</a> of <em>library</em>. The other organization type available is <a href="https://oaq-docs.github.io/publisher-workflow"><em>publisher</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-account-roles">Types of account roles</h2>

<p>The OAQ application supports several types of <strong>account roles</strong>, each with different views and permissions. Here they are in order from most to least access:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Account role</th>
      <th>Permissions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Site admin</td>
      <td>Can see and manage all organizations, including creating organizations and inviting users to an organization. Currently limited to Harvard library staff.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Organization admin</td>
      <td>Can <a href="#inviting-others-to-the-organization">invite staff to the organization</a>, <a href="organizations#managing-organization-users">manage organization users</a>, <a href="organizations#editing-organization-details">edit organization details</a>,  <a href="responses#actions-you-can-perform-on-a-response">view author responses</a>, and <a href="responses#response-status">update response statuses</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Organization staff</td>
      <td>Can <a href="responses#actions-you-can-perform-on-a-response">view author responses</a> and <a href="responses#response-status">update response statuses</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="getting-started-as-an-organization-admin">Getting started as an organization admin</h2>

<p>Before anyone from your organization can do anything in OAQ, a site admin will need to create your organization with some preliminary information that your staff can <a href="organizations#editing-organization-details">edit later</a>.</p>

<p>Your experience as a library in OAQ begins when the site admin invites the first member to the organization to be an <strong>organization admin</strong>.</p>

<p>Each invited organization admin will receive an email that contains an invitation link. If you receive one of these emails and click the link, you will be taken to a page in OAQ where you can confirm your account and create a password. Note that you can always <a href="account_management#changing-your-password">change your password</a> later.</p>

<h2 id="associating-your-organization-with-publishers">Associating your organization with publishers</h2>

<p>OAQ facilitates the sharing of questionnaire data between publishers and libraries. As a library, you can associate with specific publishers so that your organization automatically receives responses from those publishers. Only OAQ <a href="#types-of-account-roles">site admins</a> can set up publisher–library associations, so talk to the site admin who creates your organization about the publishers you wish to work with.</p>

<h2 id="inviting-others-to-the-organization">Inviting others to the organization</h2>

<p>If you are an organization admin, once you have confirmed your account, you will have the ability to invite additional members to the organization and set their <a href="#types-of-account-roles">roles</a> as either <strong>admin</strong> or <strong>staff</strong>. You can also <a href="organizations#managing-organization-users">delete and restore users</a> as needed.</p>

<h2 id="logging-in-and-out">Logging in and out</h2>

<p>To log out of OAQ, simply click the user icon in the top bar and click <strong>Logout</strong>.</p>

<p>To log in again, click <strong>Sign In</strong> in the top bar.</p>

<h2 id="changing-your-password">Changing your password</h2>

<p>You can change your password at any time by clicking the user icon in the top bar and selecting <strong>Change Password</strong>.</p>
