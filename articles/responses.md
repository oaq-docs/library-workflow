An author questionnaire is a form that a publisher sends to its authors to collect details such as name, publications, biography, contacts, professional interests, PR opportunities, etc. As a library, your organization can use this data for cataloging purposes.

A questionnaire response becomes visible to a library after the publisher has made a deliberate choice to share it. This happens at a point in the publisher's workflow when the questionnaire is locked to further changes by authors or staff.

## Associated questionnaires

When you log into OAQ as a library user, your initial view is the complete set of responses your organization has received across all [partner publishers](account_management#partnering-with-publishers). The **Questionnaire** column will show the hyperlinked name of each questionnaire associated with the response. If you click one of these hyperlinked names, you will see a list of responses for just that questionnaire.

### Exporting response data

The **Responses for _questionnaire name_** page provides you with the option to **Export all responses**. If you click this button, a CSV file containing all responses in the list will begin downloading.

You can also download individual responses by clicking the **Download** dropdown next to any response and choosing to download either a **CSV** or **PDF** file.

## Response statuses

OAQ workflows depend on updated **response statuses** for the communication of data between publishers and libraries. It's important for libraries to keep response statuses current.

Here’s an explanation of the **Status** dropdown menu options on the **Responses** page:

| Status | Meaning |
|--|--|
|Not processed|The library has received the response from the publisher but has not begun processing it.|
|Library In Progress|The library has received the response from the publisher and has begun processing it. Note that this status locks the response for publishers so that answers can't be edited.|
|Library Complete|The library has received the response from the publisher and finished processing it.|

## Actions you can perform on a response

As a library user, OAQ allows you to perform a number of actions on questionnaire responses. When you first log in—or when you click **Responses** in the top bar—you will see a list of received responses from across all publishers. The column titled **Actions** lists the actions you can perform on each response:

|Action|Result|
|--|--|
|View|Shows a view of the response in HTML format.|
|Status History|Pops up a window that shows a response's history of status-changing events.|
|View ISBN|Shows any ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 that the publisher has associated with the response.|
|Download|Begins downloading a **CSV** or **PDF** file, depending on the dropdown selection.|

## Status history

You can see the history of library-workflow events that have been performed on each response by clicking **Status History** under **Actions**. Clicking this link will pop up a window that shows:

* The email address of the user who changed the status
* The updated status
* The timestamp of the status change

If a response's status has never been changed, the popup window will be blank.
