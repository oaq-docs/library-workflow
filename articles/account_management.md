OAQ is designed to be a multi-tenant platform, which means multiple libraries can use it simultaneously with their own users and branding. This means your organization's data will remain invisible to other libraries.

Note that when we say "library" in this documentation, we mean an organization with an [organization type](organizations) of **library**. The other organization type available is [**publisher**](https://oaq-docs.github.io/publisher-workflow).

## Types of account roles

The OAQ application supports several types of **account roles**, each with different views and permissions. Here they are in order from most to least access:

| Account role | Permissions |
|--|--|
|Site admin| Can see and manage all organizations, including creating organizations and inviting users to an organization. Currently limited to Harvard library staff. |
|Organization admin | Can [invite staff to the organization](#inviting-others-to-the-organization), [manage organization users](organizations#managing-organization-users), [edit organization details](organizations#editing-organization-details),  [view author responses](responses#actions-you-can-perform-on-a-response), and [update response statuses](responses#response-status). |
|Organization staff | Can [view author responses](responses#actions-you-can-perform-on-a-response) and [update response statuses](responses#response-status) |

## Getting started as an organization admin

Before anyone from your organization can do anything in OAQ, a site admin will need to create your organization with some preliminary information that your staff can [edit later](organizations#editing-organization-details).

Your experience as a library in OAQ begins when the site admin invites the first member to the organization to be an **organization admin**.

Each invited organization admin will receive an email that contains an invitation link. If you receive one of these emails and click the link, you will be taken to a page in OAQ where you can confirm your account and create a password. Note that you can always [change your password](account_management#changing-your-password) later.

## Associating your organization with publishers

OAQ facilitates the sharing of questionnaire data between publishers and libraries. As a library, you can associate with specific publishers so that your organization automatically receives responses from those publishers. Only OAQ [site admins](#types-of-account-roles) can set up publisherâ€“library associations, so talk to the site admin who creates your organization about the publishers you wish to work with.

## Inviting others to the organization

If you are an organization admin, once you have confirmed your account, you will have the ability to invite additional members to the organization and set their [roles](#types-of-account-roles) as either **admin** or **staff**. You can also [delete and restore users](organizations#managing-organization-users) as needed.
